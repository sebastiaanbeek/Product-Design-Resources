# Product Design Resources
Collection of Product Design Resources I've found helpful. Good things happen when you make things and share them with the world.

### Idea

Started decluttering and organising my product design related bookmarks/resources. If it's worth keeping, it's worth organising.

### Important

1. _Work-in-progress_
2. This document is intended as a _living document_ and will be updated now and then to keep up with current practices.
